# Python for Linguists
These are materials for a half-day workshop given at [Georgetown University](http://georgetown.edu/)'s [Department of Linguistics](http://linguistics.georgetown.edu/) in Fall 2018.

You're probably looking for [the compiled PDF](https://github.com/lgessler/python-for-linguists/blob/master/Python_Workshop_2018.pdf).

The idea was to give graduate students in linguistics with only some exposure to Python (for running psycholinguistic experiments, for example) some footing in fundamentals of Python and programming in general. You should consider this work very experimental. If you're a linguist looking to learn Python, consider looking at [the NLTK book](https://www.nltk.org/book/) and other beginner resources.
